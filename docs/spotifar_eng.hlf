$ #Spotifar#

    #Common info#

    An alternative Spotify client implementation via Far Manager plugin. The plugin itself is just a
UI facade for the [~Spotify Web API~@https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api@], using Far Manager API
to draw panels and dialogs for a user to perform some basic manipulations with the current playback and his spotify collection. Together with the
plugin goes [~Librespot~@https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot@] playback device, which you can use for listening your collection, but keep in mind 
that it is an open source project, which has its own troubles.

    A public API provided by Spotify is quite rich on capabilities, at the same time sometimes lacks of
basic stuff, which is either implemented partially or not implemented at all. You can find detailed information
on the topic in appropriate ~paragraph~@Features@ of this help.


    #Prerequisites#

    The plugin is designed for using all the provided Spotify API, which requires #Premium Subscription# for most of operations. It still
can be used for free, but the behavior is not tested well and bunch of API calls will end up receiving "403 Forbidden" http response,
you can check all of them in the [~official docs~@https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api@].

    The built-in Librespot device as well requires #Premium Subscription# as well, which you'll not be able to use as well.


    #Quick Start#

    Before you can start using the plugin, you need to finish up a basic ~configuration~@QuickStart@, which is mandatory. It requires from you
issuing your own personal Spotify API #Client ID# and #Client Secret#, which will be used to authenticate the plugin, without knowing your login and password.

@QuickStart

    The authorization flow used by plugin is the one, provided by [~Spotify API~@https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/code-flow@]. In short,
for a better security user should generate Client ID and Client Secret, to avoid exposing his login and password directly. The plugin further, using these data,
resolves and caches an auch code and access token, which is used with every API request via Bearer token and refreshed usually hourly.


    #Obtaining your own client id and secret#

    1. Open a [~Spotify developers dashboard~@https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard@]

    2. Click #Create App# button, input your information
        - #App name# and #App description# are up to you
        - #Redirect URIs# - #http://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/callback#
        - "Which API/SDKs are you planning to use?" - pick #Web API# and #Web Playback SDK#
        - Consent an agreement with Spotify's terms and save your data

    3. Assuming you read the Help already from Far, thus the Spotifar plugin is installed, you need to open the plugin settings #Shift+Alt+F9# and
select #General# menu to open up a corresponded Settings dialog

    4. In the #Spotify API# settings block input your freshly obtained #Client ID# and #Client Secret#

    5. Leave #Port# data unchanged, unless you used a different one during your Spotify app registration in the step 2.

    6. Launch login from plugins or disks menu

    7. For the first launch, the plugin should resolve an auth code. For this it will force your default system browser to open an auth page, which 
will ask you either to login into Spotify service, if it's not done yet, or just prompt you to agree on the permissions, which plugin [~requires~@https://github.com/maliavko/spotifar/blob/f3609aff81a1ff2a14dac98973af4bcd5d097e9a/src/spotify/auth.cpp@]
for its operation. The full scope of possible Spotify API permissions you can find in the [~official docs~@https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/concepts/scopes@]

    8. If everything goes well, you will see a sub http page with success response, and can safely close it and start using the plugin

@Features

    The idea behind the plugin development was to simplify the official Spotify desktop application, bringing into focus only those which matters for daily usage.
Spotifar favors your collection above all, trying to provide you simple and efficient access to it via our beloved Far panels. Below you can find a list of features,
which are supported already, supported partially or will never be supported, unless Spotify will change their politics around their puublic API.


    #Major Spotify API changes#

    Starting from #November 27, 2024# Spotify blocked some of their web endpoints, mainly related to their internal algorythms.
In practise for the third parties it means #no accees# to:
    - all kind of recommendations and featurings: similar artists, freshly released albums, playlists created for you and etc.
    - audio analysis features


    #Supported features#

    #Collections        # &your artists, albums, tracks and playlists representation and management, you can browse your collections like it is the list of files
                        on the panel, performing most regular operations like sorting, selection and etc. as well as seeing additional Spotify API info and performing
                        operations like saving or removing from your collection

    #Recents            # &recently played tracks, artists, albums or playlists. Spotify API provides an access only to the latest 50 items, so plugin stores
                        a cache of the items up to 250 items

    #Playing Queue      # &20 first items in the playing queue, provided by Spotify API

    #New Releases       # &as the access to the fresh releases feature is blocked by API, Spotifar implements its own. A separate threaded worker once in 24 hours
                        goes through all your followed artists and searches for their most fresh releases (two weeks timeframe)

    #User top items     # &your top artist and tracks over the past sic months

    #Persistent modes   # &Spotifar saves your chosen panel view modes, sort modes and last visited views into Far config individually for each view, presented on 
the panel.

    #Player             # &a player dialog with the simple visual and all necessary basic components and controls

    #Global Hotkeys     # &possibility to register ~global hotkeys~@ConfigHotkeys@ for most of the playback player commands like play, stop, skip and etc.

    #Notifications      # &Windows toast-like pop-up notifications in the tray bar for "Now playing" and some others

    #Start playback     # &almost everywhere on the panels for tracks, albums or artists, single or multi-selected


    #Not Supported#

    #Podcasts           # &not supported at all

    #Playlists          # &only list representation via panel view, no playlists management supported yet

    #Search             # &is not done yet


    #For now, not possible to support#

    #Audio analysis     # &blocked by Spotify by their recent policies, unlikely will be unblocked and supported

    #Recommendations    # &Spotify internal algorithms are also blocked and cannot be accessed. Which means their custom playlists, radars, radios and stuff are
not accessible at all. E.g. #Weekly recommendations# playlists, formed by Spotify returns 403 Forbidden, however it can be visible 
in the #Recently played# view, can be started and even you can see part of the tracks in the #Playing Queue# view

    If you wish to see the list of reported features or you want to add some new one, visit an official Spotifar [~GitHub page~@https://github.com/maliavko/spotifar/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Afeature@]

    Be careful changing these parameters, as they can be incompatible with each others, read [~appropriate docs~@https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options@] first.


@ConfigHotkeys

    For changing the key, you put input cursor into the appropriate input field and hit the key you want to assign, the field should catch it

    #Global hotkeys         # &enabled or disabled global hotkeys

    #VKey                   # &Windows virtual key code, only for information

    #Ctrl, Shift, Alt       # &keys modifiers, use at least some, to exclude hotkeys collissions on the system level

    #play/pause             # &start or pause playback

    #skip to next           # &skip current track to the next one

    #skip to prev           # &skip current track to the previous one

    #seek forward           # &seek current track forward by 5 sec

    #seek backward          # &seek current track backward by 5 sec

    #volume up              # &raise volume by 1

    #volume down            # &decrease volume by 1

    #show toast             # &show a "Now playing" notification in the tray



@SortDialog
$ #Sort dialog#

    The default Far sorting approach is not applicable to the plugin's needs, so it was replaced by a custom-made dialog, which shows only applicable sorting modes
for the particular views. Possible modes you can face:

    #Name               # &by name

    #Unsorted           # &keep original Spotify API sorting

    #Followers          # &by number of artist's followers

    #Popularity         # &by popularity, determined by API

    #Release Data       # &by album release date

    #Album              # &by album's name

    #Artist             # &by artist's name

    #Tracks Count       # &by album's or playlist's tracks count

    #Duration           # &by total album's or track's time duration

    #Track ##            # &by track's number

    #Played At          # &by the last time an item was played at

    #Added At           # &by the time the track was added to a playlist

    #Saved At           # &by the time the item was saved to your collection

@Panels
$ #Panels UI and its capabilities#

    #Multiviews#

    The plugin operates with the views, representing some specific users view on their collections, like "recently liked tracks" or "albums tracks" etc. 
Most of the views share the same logic for the different types of items like albums, tracks or artists. So, to simplify browsing and navigating Spotifar
introduces a specific type of view - #multiview#, which encapsulates some logic inside, "Recently Liked Items" e.g., and adds to it hotkeys, for switching between
items types for the same view. For the different views a different range of switchers are available, but the mapping stays the same always.

    #Currently playing track#

    It is possible to see currenly playing track on the panel highlighted via standard Far highligting mechanism. Spotifar marks such tracks
with #Encrypted# flag, so you can create a filter in the "Far menu" -> "Options" -> "Files highligting and sort groups" and create a custom filter,
which catches only the items by Attributes, and select only #Encrypted#.

    After doing that the currenyl playing track will be visible on all the views on th epanels.
