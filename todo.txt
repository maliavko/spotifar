refactor
- investigate "market" fields for some API requests, for now completly
- alternative compilers
- noexcept

application ideas
- small improvements
    - close plugin if another librespot device is being detected
    - after two days of listening in a row, out of a sudden spotify started cutting http responses with 429 error for /player endpoint; stop/resume commands also did not work; to simulate the situation and rethink players behaviour
    - make sure big collections which hit 429 during fetching are processed well
- new functional
    - download music via https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader
    - add possibility to register librespot as a win service to avoid interrupting music when far is closed: https://github.com/kirillkovalenko/nssm
    - concerts setlists: https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html
    - upcoming events: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0
    - similar artists: https://www.music-map.com/
    - playlists and collections management
        - working with playlists through Use the snapshot_id to reduce amount of requests
    - console commands support: export, flush caches, resync fresh releases

bugs
- changing track progress with arrow on the player dialog creates a visual bug, if we receive middle playback-state update: it shows choses track position, then old position, then applies finally and show chosen position again
- turn on/off audio backend hangs waiting
