refactor
- investigate "market" fields for some API requests, for now completly unused
- noexcept

application ideas
- backlog, upcoming releases
    - close plugin if another librespot device is being detected
    - after two days of listening in a row, out of a sudden spotify started cutting http responses with 429 error for /player endpoint; stop/resume commands also did not work; to simulate the situation and rethink players behaviour
    - make sure big collections which hit 429 during fetching are processed well
    - similar artists: https://www.music-map.com/
    - playlists and collections management
        - working with playlists through Use the snapshot_id to reduce amount of requests
        - saving tracks into several playlists at the same time vis save_to_collection dialog
    - filters menu
        + albums filtering by type
        - filtering artists by genre
    - artists or albums info on some QuickView like?
        - possible in the info block by Ctrl+L
- nice to have
    - download music via https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader
    - add possibility to register librespot as a win service to avoid interrupting music when far is closed: https://github.com/kirillkovalenko/nssm
    - concerts setlists: https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html
    - upcoming events: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0
    - console commands support: export, flush caches, resync fresh releases

bugs
