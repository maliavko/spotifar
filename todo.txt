project infrastructure
- gcc support

bugs
- not enough memory: it looks like I was too much with usin stack memory, let's reconsider a usage strategy towards heap

refactor
- consider proper MVC, MVP, MVVP framework usage and code refactor to it

application ideas
- fair random while playing, different strategies for shuffling (e.g. a plain random, random of groups of tracks between different artists)
- playlists management via panels in Far
- global hotkeys?
- managing playlists via standard Far functions: create folder, move/remove from panel
