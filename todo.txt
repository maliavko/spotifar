refactor
- investigate "market" fields for some API requests, for now completly
- alternative compilers
- noexcept

application ideas
- small improvements
    - close plugin if another librespot device is being detected
- new functional
    - download music via https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader
    - add possibility to register librespot as a win service to avoid interrupting music when far is closed: https://github.com/kirillkovalenko/nssm
    - grab lyrics from here? https://lrclib.net/
    - concerts setlists: https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html
    - upcoming events: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0
    - similar artists: https://www.music-map.com/
    - playlists and collections management
        - working with playlists through Use the snapshot_id to reduce amount of requests
    - console commands support: export, flush caches, resync fresh releases
    - it is not clear what to do when a copy or cut operation is called on the track or album etc.
    - handling properly 429 error: it is detected by API separately for all the requests, so no need to throw runtime_error I think. For caches I can postpone resync for the retry-after time, notifying user with some message of outage e.g.

bugs
- after changing device in player UI, for some time is shown the old one
- console input received is being caught when the panel is active, even if cursor is out of the spotifar panel
- closing far by cross-button, while search dialog (or any other?) is opened, hangs process quite often
