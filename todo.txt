refactor
- investigate "market" fields for some API requests, for now completly
- gcc support

application ideas
- small improvements
    - goto playlist from player UI
    - showing some simple sorting's direction sign around the column name the sorting is applied to
- new functional
    + splash screen with notifications: https://github.com/mohabouje/WinToast?tab=readme-ov-file
    - add possibility to register librespot as a win service to avoid interrupting music when far is closed: https://github.com/kirillkovalenko/nssm
    - grab lyrics from here? https://lrclib.net/
    + fresh releases through musicbrainz: https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API/Search, https://github.com/metabrainz/libmusicbrainz/tree/master/examples
    - concerts setlists: https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html
    - upcoming events: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0
    - similar artists: https://www.music-map.com/
    - playlists and collections management
        - working with playlists through Use the snapshot_id to reduce amount of requests
    - console commands support
    - sort order on the panel does not have any impact on the playing order, consider of having possibility of playing albums, playlists and etc. in the order, they are sorted on the panels
    - it is not clear what to do when a copy or cut operation is called on the track or album etc.
    - handling properly 429 error: it is detected by API separately for all the requests, so no need to throw runtime_error I think. For caches I can postpone resync for the retry-after time, notifying user with some message of outage e.g.

bugs
- if a current playback context is "artist", when hit artist name in the player ui, crush happens
- to add lock_guard to the access API caches and especially to the resync method
- if the playing queue is opened and 'shuffle' is clicked, the queue is not updated
- if I open plugin through the disk menu on the passive panel all my PANEL_ACTIVE refreshings are faling miserably
- if librespot crashes, the far with plugin opened does not close
+ after long idle: the player's controls are locked, using global hotkey for start playback raises an error 404, the message of the error is not shown, only status code
- crash if start plugin when it is already started
+ skipping tracks quickly creates a queue of toasts
- toast like buttong should be unlike in case the track is saved
+ recent releases thread bloks far from closing while sleeps

to finish for alpha release
+ disabled shuffle plus, move it to some separate branch
- help window
- remove unfinished menus
- to review TODOs
- to finalize "featuring" menus, user top items menu
- to implement filter menu on each view
- to add a proper github support: license, automations? binaries
+ to add a proper errors handling
+ loading splash screen
- localizations
+ finilize the settings menu
    + audio backend view with options
    + propagate spotify settings to librespot: normalisation, autoplay-similar, bitrate and etc. https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options
- to review the panels views and clean up the view and sort modes
    - to show saved albums, artists and tracks
    - to launch playback from all the possible views
    - track number/dosci number is shown weird
