project infrastructure
- gcc support

refactor
- the librespot and process winapi is written poorly, wrap it up well; add possibility to register it as a win service to avoid interrupting music when far is closed
- working with plpaylists through Use the snapshot_id to reduce amount of requests
- investigate "market" fields for some API requests, for now completly
- parallelize playlists and saved tracks request via pool, using offset and limit fields
- propagate spotify settings to librespot: normalisation, autoplay-similar, bitrate and etc. https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options

application ideas
- grab lyrics from here? https://coda.io/@musixmatch/musixmatch-lyrics-api
- is there other way to track fresh releases?
- panels
    - ctrl + I - filtering of albums? singles/EPs/LPs; maybe something else?
    - managing playlists via standard Far functions: create folder, move/remove from panel
    - while an album or playlist is on the panel and player is shown, update a selection of file in accordance to the playing track
    - F3 on folders -> start playback
    - custom columns to show additional info, track lenght and etc
    - local far hotkey to open app player even if a spotifar panel is passive
    - comamnds for console input?
- player UI
    - goto playlist
    - extended player view with the list of tracks (or maybe on panel?)
    - recreate a volume control into slider?

bugs
- after refreshing an access token, the plugin starts one more librespot process
- on the album tracks view search files with Alt does not work properly due to year in the name
- big http cache causes plugin to freeze while closing
- metallica ride the lightning delux has multiply discs, show incorrect on the panel
- Bi-2, Мяу Кисс ми; 5th track is empty
