project infrastructure
- gcc support


refactor
- add possibility to register librespot as a win service to avoid interrupting music when far is closed
- working with playlists through Use the snapshot_id to reduce amount of requests
- investigate "market" fields for some API requests, for now completly
- parallelize playlists and saved tracks request via pool, using offset and limit fields
- propagate spotify settings to librespot: normalisation, autoplay-similar, bitrate and etc. https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options
- chnge all the api_proxy to the std:weak_ptr instances


application ideas
- grab lyrics from here? https://lrclib.net/
- is there other way to track fresh releases?
- panels
    - ctrl + I - filtering of albums? singles/EPs/LPs; maybe something else?
    - managing playlists via standard Far functions: create folder, move/remove from panel
    - comamnds for console input?
    - show track progress on the win tray icon with ACTL_SETPROGRESSSTATE
- player UI
    - goto playlist
    - recreate a volume control into slider?

- invalid spotify api items (client id or port e.g.)
- 429 too many requests emulation
- sudden network outage
