refactor
- investigate "market" fields for some API requests, for now completly
- alternative compilers
- noexcept

application ideas
- small improvements
    - view are being populated on the fly usually in get_items() method, which works, but reduced performance at each redraw, which mainly require only redraw, but no items update; consider separating api collection populating from redrawing the panels, see saved_tracks_view e.g.
    - too many events classes, consider unifying some of them; plus maybe to move them somewhere to the separate file to reduce dependencies
    - think over the namings of lng keys, they are too long
    - close plugin if another librespot device is being detected
    - folow/unfollow artists
- new functional
    - show somewhere in UI the fresh releases synch status
    - to move followed artists to the collection cache, to add followed status on some panels like 'top user artists'
    + add redirect to Spotify website after shift+enter hit
    + win toast notifications: https://github.com/mohabouje/WinToast?tab=readme-ov-file
    - add possibility to register librespot as a win service to avoid interrupting music when far is closed: https://github.com/kirillkovalenko/nssm
    - grab lyrics from here? https://lrclib.net/
    + fresh releases through musicbrainz: https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_API/Search, https://github.com/metabrainz/libmusicbrainz/tree/master/examples
    - concerts setlists: https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html
    - upcoming events: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0
    - similar artists: https://www.music-map.com/
    - playlists and collections management
        - working with playlists through Use the snapshot_id to reduce amount of requests
    - console commands support: export, flush caches, resync fresh releases
    - sort order on the panel does not have any impact on the playing order, consider of having possibility of playing albums, playlists and etc. in the order, they are sorted on the panels
    - it is not clear what to do when a copy or cut operation is called on the track or album etc.
    - handling properly 429 error: it is detected by API separately for all the requests, so no need to throw runtime_error I think. For caches I can postpone resync for the retry-after time, notifying user with some message of outage e.g.

bugs
- new releases has doubles on the panel

    + to show saved albums, artists and tracks

    + track number/disc number is shown weird
