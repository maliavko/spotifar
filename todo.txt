project infrastructure
- gcc support

refactor
- working with plpaylists through Use the snapshot_id to reduce amount of requests
- consider reformatting code to the style like in thread-pool library e.g.

application ideas
- fair random while playing with shuffle, different strategies for shuffling (e.g. a plain random, random of groups of tracks between different artists)
- global hotkeys?
- panels
    - ctrl + I - filtering of albums? singles/EPs/LPs; maybe something else?
    - managing playlists via standard Far functions: create folder, move/remove from panel
    - while an album or playlist is on the panel and player is shown, update a selection of file in accordance to the playing track
    - F3 on folders
- player UI
    - to add an artist main genre
    - to add an album type postfix, e.g. "Album Name [EP]"
    - to add clickable links to the artist/albums/tracks HTTP pages
    - to add a label about the playing context: album, playlist etc.
    - goto artist, album, playlist etc.

- when changing the volume, if some offset is about to be applied and change it one more time, it does not increment from the last offset, but from some another value
