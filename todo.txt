refactor
- investigate "market" fields for some API requests, for now completly unused
- noexcept

application ideas
- backlog, upcoming releases
    - to add a collection playlist to the saved playlists view
    - move plugin version and guids to CMake? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33805311/how-can-i-generate-a-guid-in-cmake
    - to add the config setting to pick the amount of past weeks for fresh releases search
    - close plugin if another librespot device is being detected
    - after two days of listening in a row, out of a sudden spotify started cutting http responses with 429 error for /player endpoint; stop/resume commands also did not work; to simulate the situation and rethink players behaviour
    - make sure big collections which hit 429 during fetching are processed well
    - similar artists: https://www.music-map.com/
    - playlists and collections management
        - working with playlists through Use the snapshot_id to reduce amount of requests
        - saving tracks into several playlists at the same time vis save_to_collection dialog
    - filters menu
        + albums filtering by type
        - filtering artists by genre
    - artists or albums info on some QuickView like?
        - possible in the info block by Ctrl+L
- nice to have
    - download music via https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader
    - add possibility to register librespot as a win service to avoid interrupting music when far is closed: https://github.com/kirillkovalenko/nssm
    - concerts setlists: https://api.setlist.fm/docs/1.0/index.html
    - upcoming events: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/Bandsintown/PublicAPI/3.0.0
    - console commands support: export, flush caches, resync fresh releases
    - https://github.com/AlienCowEatCake/WinToastLibC library to non-msvc compilers

bugs
- some not-simple-to-fix: when any API cache storage is synced it saves its next sync time; for some caches the resync interval depends on some conditions, which means, if conditions changed and the resync interval changed as well, the changes will not appy until the next resync

to finish for alpha release
- add gallery of schreenshots
+ check all the default view settings and sort modes
+ to saved/remove artists, albums and tracks, to show their status on the panels
+ disabled shuffle plus, move it to some separate branch
+ help window
+ remove unfinished menus
+ to review TODOs
+ to finalize "featuring" menus, user top items menu
+ to implement filter menu on each view
+ to add a proper github support: license, automations? binaries
+ to add a proper errors handling
+ loading splash screen
+ localizations
+ finilize the settings menu
    + audio backend view with options
    + propagate spotify settings to librespot: normalisation, autoplay-similar, bitrate and etc. https://github.com/librespot-org/librespot/wiki/Options
+ to review the panels views and clean up the view and sort modes
    + to show saved albums, artists and tracks
    + to launch playback from all the possible views
    + track number/disc number is shown weird
