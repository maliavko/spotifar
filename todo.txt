application ideas

- panels
    - ctrl + I - filtering of albums? singles/EPs/LPs; maybe something else?
    - managing playlists via standard Far functions: create folder, move/remove from panel
    - while an album or playlist is on the panel and player is shown, update a selection of file in accordance to the playing track
    - F3 on folders
    - custom columns to show additional info, track lenght and etc
    - local far hotkey to open app player even if a spotifar panel is passive
    - comamnds for console input?
    - on the album tracks view search files with Alt does not work properly due to year in the name
- player UI
    - to add an artist main genre
    - to add an album type postfix, e.g. "Album Name [EP]"
    - to add clickable links to the artist/albums/tracks HTTP pages
    - goto artist, album, playlist etc.
    - to finishe up likes in the player
    - extended player view with the list of tracks (or maybe on panel?)
    - recreate a volume control into slider?
