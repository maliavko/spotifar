project infrastructure
- gcc support

bugs
- not enough memory: it looks like I was too much with usin stack memory, let's reconsider a usage strategy towards heap
- librespot quite ofte catches the error: Remote connectino ws forcibly closed, investigate: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51719641/an-existing-connection-was-forcibly-closed-by-the-remote-host-web-api

refactor
- consider proper MVC, MVP, MVVP framework usage and code refactor to it
- add a proper logging

application ideas
- fair random while playing, different strategies for shuffling (e.g. a plain random, random of groups of tracks between different artists)
- playlists management via panels in Far
- global hotkeys?
- managing playlists via standard Far functions: create folder, move/remove from panel
- consider a nice progress icon with unicode symbols https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Elements
