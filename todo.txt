- to add lock_guard to the access API caches and especially to the resync method

- to review TODOs
- to finalize "featuring" menus, user top items menu

- to finish up librespot process start up and propagating its settings to the config dialog
+ loading splash screen

- finilize the settings menu
    - audio backend view with options
